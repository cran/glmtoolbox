\usage{
\method{cooks.distance}{glmgee}(
  model,
  method = c("Preisser-Qaqish", "full"),
  level = c("clusters", "observations"),
  plot.it = FALSE,
  coefs,

}
\arguments{
\item{model}{an object of class \emph{glmgee}.}

\item{method}{an (optional) character string indicating the method of calculation for the \emph{one-step approximation}. The options are: the \emph{one-step approximation} described by Preisser and Qaqish (1996) in which the working-correlation matrix is assumed to be known ("Preisser-Qaqish"); and the "authentic" \emph{one-step approximation} ("full"). By default, \code{method} is set to be "Preisser-Qaqish".}

\item{level}{an (optional) character string indicating the level for which the Cook's distance is required. The options are: cluster-level ("clusters") and observation-level ("observations"). By default, \code{level} is set to be "clusters".}

\item{plot.it}{an (optional) logical indicating if the plot of Cook's distance is required or just the data matrix in which that plot is based. By default, \code{plot.it} is set to be FALSE.}

\item{coefs}{an (optional) character string which (partially) match with the names of some of the parameters in the linear predictor.}

\item{identify}{an (optional) integer indicating the number of clusters to identify on the plot of Cook's distance. This is only appropriate if \code{plot.it=TRUE}.}

\item{varest}{an (optional) character string indicating the type of estimator which should be used to the variance-covariance matrix of the interest parameters. The available options are: robust sandwich-type estimator ("robust"), degrees-of-freedom-adjusted estimator ("df-adjusted"), bias-corrected estimator ("bias-corrected"), and the model-based or naive estimator ("model"). By default, \code{varest} is set to be "robust".}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods. If \code{plot.it=TRUE} then \code{...} may be used to include graphical parameters to customize the plot. For example,  \code{col}, \code{pch}, \code{cex}, \code{main}, \code{sub}, \code{xlab}, \code{ylab}.}
}
\value{
A matrix as many rows as clusters/observations in the sample and one column with the values of the Cook's distance.
}
\description{
Produces an approximation, better known as the \emph{one-step aproximation},
of the Cook's distance, which is aimed to measure the effect on the estimates of the parameters in the linear predictor
of deleting each cluster/observation in turn. This function also can produce a cluster/observation-index plot of the
Cook's distance for all parameters in the linear predictor or for some subset of them (via the argument \code{coefs}).
}
\details{
The Cook's distance consists of the \emph{distance} between two estimates of the
parameters in the linear predictor using a metric based on the (estimate of the) variance-covariance matrix. For the cluster-level,
the first one set of estimates is computed from a dataset including all clusters/observations, and the second one is computed from a dataset in which the \emph{i}-th cluster is excluded. To avoid computational burden, the second set of estimates is replaced by its \emph{one-step approximation}. See the \link{dfbeta.glmgee} documentation.

###### Example 1: Effect of ozone-enriched atmosphere on growth of sitka spruces
mod1 <- size ~ poly(days,4) + treat
fit1 <- glmgee(mod1, id=tree, family=Gamma("log"), data=spruces, corstr="AR-1")

### Cook's distance for all parameters in the linear predictor
cooks.distance(fit1, method="full", plot.it=TRUE, col="red", lty=1, lwd=1, cex=0.8,
               col.lab="blue", col.axis="blue", col.main="black", family="mono")

### Cook's distance for the parameter associated to the variable 'treat'
cooks.distance(fit1, coef="treat", method="full", plot.it=TRUE, col="red", lty=1,
               lwd=1, col.lab="blue", col.axis="blue", col.main="black", cex=0.8)
