  \item{age}{a numeric vector indicating the age of the volunteer.}
  \item{rinse}{a factor indicating the type of rinse used by the volunteer: "Placebo", "A" and "B".}
  \item{smoke}{a factor indicating if the volunteer smoke: "Yes" and "No".}

\description{
These data arose from a dental clinical study. In
this trial, subjects were generally healthy adult male and female
volunteers, ages 18â€“55, with pre-existing plaque but without
advanced periodontal disease. Prior to entry, subjects were
screened for a minimum of 20 sound, natural teeth and a minimum
mean plaque index of 2.0. Subjects with gross oral pathology or
on antibiotic, antibacterial, or anti-inflammatory therapy were
excluded from the study. One hundred nine volunteers were
randomized in a double-blinded way to one of two new mouth
rinses (A and B) or to a control mouth rinse. Plaque was scored
at baseline, at 3 months, and at 6 months by the Turesky
modification of the Quigley-Hein index, a continuous measure.
Four subjects had missing plaque scores. The main objective
of the analysis is to measure the effectiveness of the three
mouth rinses in inhibiting the development of dental plaque.
