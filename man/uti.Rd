\title{Urinary Tract Infections in HIV-infected Men}
\format{
A data frame with 98 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
  \item{episodes}{a numeric vector indicating the number of episodes, that is, the number of times each patient had urinary tract infections (UTI).}
  \item{time}{a numeric vector indicating the time to follow up, in months.}
  \item{cd4}{a numeric vector indicating the immune status of the patient as measured by the CD4+ cell counts.}
}
}
\usage{
data(uti)
}
\description{
These data arose from a study conducted in the Department of
Internal Medicine at the Utrecht University Hospital, the Netherlands, where
98 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men were followed up to two
years. Urinary cultures were obtained during the first visit and every six
months thereafter. Also, cultures were obtained between regular scheduled
visits when signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections (UTI) occurred,
or when patients had fever of unknown origin. CD4+ cell counts were also
measured. A CD4+ count is a blood test to determine how well the immune
system is working in people who have been diagnosed with HIV. In general,
a decreasing CD4+ count is an indication of the progression of HIV. See
Hoepelman et al. (1992), van den Broek (1995), Morel and Nagaraj (2012, page 175).
